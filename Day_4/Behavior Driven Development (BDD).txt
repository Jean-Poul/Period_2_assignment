What is Behavior Driven Development?
Behavior Driven Development (BDD) is a branch of Test Driven Development (TDD). BDD uses human-readable 
descriptions of software user requirements as the basis for software tests. Like Domain Driven Design (DDD), 
an early step in BDD is the definition of a shared vocabulary between stakeholders, domain experts, and 
engineers. This process involves the definition of entities, events, and outputs that the users care about, 
and giving them names that everybody can agree on.
BDD practitioners then use that vocabulary to create a domain specific language they can use to encode 
system tests such as User Acceptance Tests (UAT).
Each test is based on a user story written in the formally specified ubiquitous language based on English. 
(A ubiquitous language is a vocabulary shared by all stakeholders.)
