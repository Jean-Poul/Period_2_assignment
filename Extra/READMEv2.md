# Period-2 Node, Express with TypeScript, JavaScript Backend 
Testing, MongoDB (and Geo-location) 

## Explain Pros & Cons in using Node.js + Express to implement your Backend compared to a strategy using, for example, Java/JAX-RS/Tomcat
## Answer:

## Explain the difference between Debug outputs and ApplicationLogging. What’s wrong with console.log(..) statements in our backend code?
## Answer:

## Demonstrate a system using application logging and environment controlled debug statements.
## - Answer:

## Explain, using relevant examples, concepts related to testing a REST-API using Node/JavaScript/Typescript + relevant packages 
## Answer:

## Explain a setup for Express/Node/Test/Mongo-DB/GraphQL development with Typescript, and how it handles "secret values",  debug, debug-outputs, application logging and testing.
## Answer:

## Explain, preferably using an example, how you have deployed your node/Express applications, and which of the Express Production best practices you have followed.
## Answer:

## Explain possible steps to deploy many node/Express servers on the same droplet, how to deploy the code and how to ensure servers will continue to operate, even after a droplet restart.
## Answer:

## Explain, your chosen strategy to deploy a Node/Express application including how to solve the following deployment problems:
   - •	Ensure that you Node-process restarts after a (potential) exception that closed the application
   - •	Ensure that you Node-process restarts after a server (Ubuntu) restart
   - •	Ensure that you can run “many” node-applications on a single droplet on the same port (80)
## Answer:

## Explain, using relevant examples, the Express concept; middleware.
## Answer:

## Explain, using relevant examples, your strategy for implementing a REST-API with Node/Express  + TypeScript and demonstrate how you have tested the API.
## Answer:

## Explain, using relevant examples, how to test JavaScript/Typescript Backend Code, relevant packages (Mocha, Chai etc.) and how to test asynchronous code.
## Answer:

# NoSQL and MongoDB 
## Explain, generally, what is meant by a NoSQL database.
## Answer:

## Explain Pros & Cons in using a NoSQL database like MongoDB as your data store, compared to a traditional Relational SQL Database like MySQL.
## Answer:

## Explain about indexes in MongoDB, how to create them, and demonstrate how you have used them.
## Answer:

## Explain, using your own code examples, how you have used some of MongoDB's "special" indexes like TTL and 2dsphere and perhaps also the Unique Index.
## Answer:

## Demonstrate, using a REST-API designed by you, how to perform all CRUD operations on a MongoDB
## Answer:

## Explain, using a relevant example, a full JavaScript backend including relevant test cases to test the REST-API (not on the production database)
## Answer:

## Demonstrate, using your own code-samples, decisions you have made regarding → normalization vs denormalization 
## Answer:
