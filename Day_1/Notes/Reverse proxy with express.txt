Use a reverse proxy
A reverse proxy sits in front of a web app and performs supporting operations on the requests, apart from directing requests to the app. 
It can handle error pages, compression, caching, serving files, and load balancing among other things.

Handing over tasks that do not require knowledge of application state to a reverse proxy frees up Express to perform specialized 
application tasks. For this reason, it is recommended to run Express behind a reverse proxy like Nginx or HAProxy in production.
